# Deploy the whole stack manually from Azure Portal
Following [Deploy DeepSeek R1 using Azure AI Foundry and Build a Web Chatbot | No Charges for API Use](https://youtu.be/pj2knBX4S1w?si=I2_7MniDn0Us9bl0), I checked [DeepSeek models availability](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/deploy-models-serverless-availability#deepseek-models-from-microsoft) and found a few regions are available. 

After deployment, I have also tested the playground, works fine.
